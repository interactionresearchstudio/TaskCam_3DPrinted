# ProbeTools TaskCam beta
## 3D Printed housing for the ProbeTools TaskCam

This TaskCam housing has been developed on Dimension Elite and Makerbot 2 fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printers, but should be reproducible on any platform.

The five components have been optimised to use little or no support material during building as each component features a flat face and no undercuts.

If using a Makerbot or similar system, it is recommended to print components without a raft.
